With a strong focus on product development, I thrive at the intersection of engineering and business. Whether it’s collaborating with stakeholders to define product requirements or architecting systems that can scale, I’m passionate about driving both what gets built and how it’s built. My expertise spans backend development, cloud infrastructure, and API design, but what truly excites me is solving real user problems through thoughtful, efficient technology.</description></item></channel></rss>
