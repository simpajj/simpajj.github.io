Hi, I’m Simon—a software engineer with 10 years of
experience leading teams to build innovative, scalable
solutions for both startups and large enterprises.

With a strong focus on product development, I thrive at the
intersection of engineering and business. Whether it’s
collaborating with stakeholders to define product
requirements or architecting systems that can scale, I’m
passionate about driving both what gets built and how it’s
built. My expertise spans backend development, cloud
infrastructure, and API design, but what truly excites me is
solving real user problems through thoughtful, efficient
technology.

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to lead engineering
teams through all stages of the product lifecycle—from
ideation and prototyping to deployment and scaling. I’m
committed to fostering a culture of collaboration and
excellence, ensuring teams deliver high-quality solutions
that align with business goals.

If you're looking to collaborate or just talk shop, feel
free to reach out—I’m always open to connecting!
